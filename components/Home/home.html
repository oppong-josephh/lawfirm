            <p>
              Divorce and separation is the legal ending of a marriage by a
              court that officially dissolves the bonds of matrimony between a

            <p>
              The word “probate" refers to the process of winding up a deceased
              person’s affairs. The Probate Division of the courthouse handles
              the administration of Estates. The purpose of an Estate case is
              the orderly distribution of belongings and payment of debts a
              person who has died.

              family law case, in a final judgment or final order, you may be
              able to correct these mistakes by filing an appeal—the appeal
              would address mistakes or misapplications of the law. If you wish
              you file an appeal you must act immediately following the
              rendition of the final judgment or final order.

              Assets can be lost to spouses in a divorce, creditors of the
              estate or beneficiary, or to poor spending habits of the
              beneficiary. In addition, outright gifting can incur a gift and
              estate tax bill with substantial losses before assets ever reach
              the intended beneficiaries. Our team of experts in the area of
              wealth protection is committed to giving you the most appropriate

            <p>
              Alimony (sometimes called spousal support) is financial support
              paid by one former spouse to the other after a divorce or a legal
              separation. It may be granted for a specific period of time or
              indefinitely until the court changes it. Either spouse may request
              alimony. The purpose of alimony is to provide “reasonable and
              necessary" support.

            <h5>Wills​</h5>
            <p>
              A will and its requirements. A will is a person's expressed
              intention of what should be done with his/her property after that
              person dies. It must be in writing, signed by the person creating
              the will (the "testator") and witnessed by two persons. The
              testator normally must have attained the age of majority, and must
              be of "sound mind" at the time the will is executed. A married
              minor is usually capable of executing a will.
